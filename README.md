# About PhotoEditor SDK for Android

## Overview

The [PhotoEditor SDK](https://www.photoeditorsdk.com/?utm_campaign=Projects&utm_source=Github&utm_medium=PESDK&utm_content=Android-Demo&utm_term=Android) is a powerful and multifaceted tool which enables you to equip your Android application with high-performant photo editing capabilities. The PhotoEditor SDK is written in Java and can easily be customized to entirely blend with your CI and provide your users with the exact feature set your use-case requires.

The SDK ships with a large variety of filters, covering all state of the art style- and mood settings that can be previewed in real-time. Unlike other apps that allow a live preview of filters, the [PhotoEditor SDK](https://www.photoeditorsdk.com/?utm_campaign=Projects&utm_source=Github&utm_medium=PESDK&utm_content=Android-Demo&utm_term=Android) even provides a live preview when using high-resolution images.

All operations are non-destructive which allows for fast and uncomplicated revision of the creatives at any given time and creates an intuitive and creative workflow for your users. Please see Features for a detailed list of the photo editing tools included in the [PhotoEditor SDK](https://www.photoeditorsdk.com/?utm_campaign=Projects&utm_source=Github&utm_medium=PESDK&utm_content=Android-Demo&utm_term=Android).

## Features

* Over 60 handcrafted **Filters** covering all state of the art style- and mood settings to choose from.
* Design custom filters in Photoshop and other apps: The API of the PhotoEditor SDK enables you to expand the filter library with your own set of custom filters to define a unique visual language. Custom filters can easily be created by anyone using LUTs (Lookup Tables) from popular apps like Photoshop, GIMP or Lightroom. Design your filter and apply it onto the provided identity image. That will 'record' the filter response, now simply save it and add it as a new filter. Done.
* An **Overlay** Tool that can be used to create neat lighting effects like lens flare or bokeh but also to furnish pictures with textures like crumpled paper or plaster. You can easily expand the library by importing your own set of overlay assets.
* An **Adjustment section** that holds both essential and advanced photo editing features like brightness, contrast, saturation, clarity etc. that help tweak and fine tune images to create stunning creatives.
* A **Transform section** that unifies cropping, flipping and rotation in one feature.
* The robust **Text Feature** provides all necessary functions for quickly adding text to any picture or creative. The corresponding font library can easily be exchanged, reduced, or expanded.
* A categorized **Sticker library** whose UI is optimized for exploration and discovery. You can easily complement the library with your own custom sticker packages.
* A **Frame Tool** that works with any given photo size or ratio.
* A high performant **Brush Engine** optimized for touch screen that supports different brush strokes.
* A **Photo Roll** equipped with a wide range of stock photography and templates with presorted categories. The API allows for easy expansion, reduction and rearrangement of the assets.
* A clean and intuitive **UI** that ensures an unhindered flow of creativity and a seamless experience while composing creatives. The UI is designed to be customized to completely match your CI and blend with your app.
* You can strip out every feature you deem unnecessary to provide your users with the exact feature set your use case requires.

* __Android API Level 16+__ Covers nearly 99% of all Android devices with touchscreen.
* __Fast image export up to 4294 MegaPixel__
* __Generic camera support__ for most Android phones.
* __Tablet support__: The PhotoEditor SDK uses auto layout for its views and adapts to each screen size.
* **Non/destructive features and effects:** Quickly revise, redo or even discard your work.

## Author

9elements GmbH, [@PhotoEditorSDK](https://twitter.com/PhotoEditorSDK), [www.photoeditorsdk.com](https://www.photoeditorsdk.com/?utm_campaign=Projects&utm_source=Github&utm_medium=PESDK&utm_content=Android-Demo&utm_term=Android)


## Installation

> This SDK requires a minimum deployment target of Android API 15 (4.0.4) with OpenGl ES 2.0 supported Device but our official support is starting with API 16 (4.1.0)

## Add your license file

Before using any components of the PhotoEditor SDK, you have to add your license file to your applications assets folder.
The expected default name of the license file is "LICENSE". In order to change this, see licencePath option of PESDKConfig in your gradle file.

The license is digitally signed and can't be altered without becoming invalid. Our sample app comes with its own license, so you can try that right away. To try our SDK in your own app, you need to request a trial license that's bound to your bundle identifier. You can start a trial [here](https://www.photoeditorsdk.com/users/new) and download your license file from your [dashboard](https://www.photoeditorsdk.com/dashboard).

Once the license file has been added the application will validate its presence upon launch.

## Setting up the workspace

Please ensure that our artifactory repository is listed in your repositories in the project’s build.gradle file:

```groovy
// Add the PESDK repository and plugin dependency
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        google()
        maven { url "https://artifactory.img.ly/artifactory/imgly" }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'ly.img.android.pesdk:PESDKPlugin:6.2.8'
    }
}

```

You will have to add the pesdk plugin and PESDKConfig into your module's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
// Apply the Android Plugin
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

// Apply the PESDKPlugin
apply plugin: PESDKPlugin

// Configure the PESDKPlugin
PESDKConfig {

    licencePath "LICENSE" // Name of the Licence file in the asset folder

    // Write here the newest SDK verion you will here https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-android-demo/releases

__Sync your project with the Gradle files after every edit!__
For more information about Gradle, please take a look at the [Android Developer Documentation](http://developer.android.com/tools/building/configuring-gradle.html)

## Android Permissions

The PhotoEditor SDK requires two permissions: The "_Write access to external storage_" and the "_Camera_" permission (if you include the Camera module).
You can grant this permissions yourself otherwise the SDK will automatically grant these permissions

__Please take a look at the hint in the next step in order to integrate the Android 6.0 permission request correct!__

## Integration

In order to open the camera preview and pass the resulting image to the editor, create a
`CameraPreviewBuilder` and start the `CameraPreviewActivity` with `startActivityForResult(activity, custom_id)`:

> __Please make sure you delegate the `onRequestPermissionsResult` to `PermissionRequest.onRequestPermissionsResult`
as demonstrated in the following example. This ensures correct behavior on Android 6.0 and above.__

```java
public class CameraDemoActivity extends Activity implements PermissionRequest.Response {

    // Important permission request for Android 6.0 and above, don't forget to add this!
    @Override
    public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, @NonNull String[] permissions, @NonNull int[] grantResults) {
        PermissionRequest.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
        super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
    }

    @Override
    public void permissionGranted() {}

    @Override
    public void permissionDenied() {
        /* TODO: The Permission was rejected by the user. The Editor was not opened,
         * Show a hint to the user and try again. */
    }

    public static int PESDK_RESULT = 1;

    private SettingsList createPesdkSettingsList() {

        // Create a empty new SettingsList and apply the changes on this referance.
        SettingsList settingsList = new SettingsList();

        // If you include our asset Packs and you use our UI you also need to add them to the UI,
        // otherwise they are only available for the backend
        // See the specific feature sections of our guides if you want to know how to add our own Assets.

        settingsList.getSettingsModel(UiConfigFilter.class).setFilterList(
          FilterPackBasic.getFilterPack()
        );

        settingsList.getSettingsModel(UiConfigText.class).setFontList(
          FontPackBasic.getFontPack()
        );

        settingsList.getSettingsModel(UiConfigFrame.class).setFrameList(
          FramePackBasic.getFramePack()
        );

        settingsList.getSettingsModel(UiConfigOverlay.class).setOverlayList(
          OverlayPackBasic.getOverlayPack()
        );

        settingsList.getSettingsModel(UiConfigSticker.class).setStickerLists(
          StickerPackEmoticons.getStickerCategory(),
          StickerPackShapes.getStickerCategory()
        );

        // Set custom camera image export settings
        settingsList.getSettingsModel(CameraSettings.class)
          .setExportDir(Directory.DCIM, "SomeFolderName")
          .setExportPrefix("camera_");

        // Set custom editor image export settings
        settingsList.getSettingsModel(EditorSaveSettings.class)
          .setExportDir(Directory.DCIM, "SomeFolderName")
          .setExportPrefix("result_")
          .setSavePolicy(EditorSaveSettings.SavePolicy.RETURN_ALWAYS_ONLY_OUTPUT);

        return settingsList;
    }

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        openCamera();
    }

    private void openCamera() {
        SettingsList settingsList = createPesdkSettingsList();

        new CameraPreviewBuilder(this)
          .setSettingsList(settingsList)
          .startActivityForResult(this, PESDK_RESULT);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, android.content.Intent data) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
        if (resultCode == RESULT_OK && requestCode == PESDK_RESULT) {
            // Editor has saved an Image.
            Uri resultURI = data.getParcelableExtra(ImgLyIntent.RESULT_IMAGE_URI);
            Uri sourceURI = data.getParcelableExtra(ImgLyIntent.SOURCE_IMAGE_URI);

            // Scan result uri to show it up in the Gallery
            if (resultURI != null) {
                sendBroadcast(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE).setData(resultURI));
            }

            // Scan source uri to show it up in the Gallery
            if (sourceURI != null) {
                sendBroadcast(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE).setData(sourceURI));
            }

            Log.i("PESDK", "Source image is located here " + sourceURI);
            Log.i("PESDK", "Result image is located here " + resultURI);

            // TODO: Do something with the result image

            // OPTIONAL: read the latest state to save it as a serialisation
            SettingsList lastState = data.getParcelableExtra(ImgLyIntent.SETTINGS_LIST);
            try {
                new PESDKFileWriter(lastState).writeJson(new File(
                  Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(),
                  "serialisationReadyToReadWithPESDKFileReader.json"
                ));
            } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }

        } else if (resultCode == RESULT_CANCELED && requestCode == PESDK_RESULT) {

            // Editor was canceled
            Uri sourceURI = data.getParcelableExtra(ImgLyIntent.SOURCE_IMAGE_URI);
            // TODO: Do something...
        }
    }
}
```

### Start Editor standalone (without camera).

If you want to open the editor directly with an existing image look at this example:

```java
public class EditorDemoActivity extends Activity implements PermissionRequest.Response {

    // Important permission request for Android 6.0 and above, don't forget to add this!
    @Override
    public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, @NonNull String[] permissions, @NonNull int[] grantResults) {
        PermissionRequest.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
        super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
    }

    @Override
    public void permissionGranted() {}

    @Override
    public void permissionDenied() {
        /* TODO: The Permission was rejected by the user. The Editor was not opened,
         * Show a hint to the user and try again. */
    }

    public static int PESDK_RESULT = 1;
    public static int GALLERY_RESULT = 2;

    private SettingsList createPesdkSettingsList() {



        // Create a empty new SettingsList and apply the changes on this referance.
        SettingsList settingsList = new SettingsList();

        // If you include our asset Packs and you use our UI you also need to add them to the UI,
        // otherwise they are only available for the backend
        // See the specific feature sections of our guides if you want to know how to add our own Assets.

        settingsList.getSettingsModel(UiConfigFilter.class).setFilterList(
            FilterPackBasic.getFilterPack()
        );

        settingsList.getSettingsModel(UiConfigText.class).setFontList(
          FontPackBasic.getFontPack()
        );

        settingsList.getSettingsModel(UiConfigFrame.class).setFrameList(
          FramePackBasic.getFramePack()
        );

        settingsList.getSettingsModel(UiConfigOverlay.class).setOverlayList(
          OverlayPackBasic.getOverlayPack()
        );

        settingsList.getSettingsModel(UiConfigSticker.class).setStickerLists(
          StickerPackEmoticons.getStickerCategory(),
          StickerPackShapes.getStickerCategory()
        );

        // Set custom editor image export settings
        settingsList.getSettingsModel(EditorSaveSettings.class)
