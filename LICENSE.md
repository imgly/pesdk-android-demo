Version 2024.01

### **1. Subject Matter**

**1.1** These Terms of Service (together with any applicable Order Form the "**Agreement**") govern all rights granted by Licensor to use and commercially exploit any of the IMG.LY SDKs (the "**Software**"), namely the CreativeEditor SDK and/or PhotoEditor SDK and/or VideoEditor SDK and/or imglyKit SDK.

**1.2** The Agreement is entered into by and between IMG.LY GmbH, Kortumstraße 19-21, 44787 Bochum, Germany (the "**Licensor**") and the entity identified in the Order Form (the "**Licensee**", together with Licensor the "**Parties**") as of the effective date the Order Form is last signed on.

**1.3** This Agreement shall govern the use of the Software for commercial purposes. To the extent the Software is intended to be used for non-commercial purposes only, an alternative licensing scheme may be available upon Licensor's discretion.

### **2. Order Form**

**2.1** An "**Order Form**" may either be executed (i) by the Parties upon individual negotiation or (ii) via an online order issued by Licensee via Licensor's website at [img.ly](https://img.ly) (the "**Website**") that has been confirmed by Licensor. Online orders not confirmed within 14 days after issuance shall be considered denied.

**2.2** No rights shall be granted to Licensee by virtue of these Terms of Service alone as such grant requires the execution of an Order Form making reference to these Terms of Service.

**2.3** The Order Form shall specify the environment for the Software that shall be licensed by Licensee. The Software is currently available for integration in the following environments, but is not limited to: (i) Web, (ii) iOS, (iii) Android, and (iv) Node.js.

**2.4** The Order Form shall specify (i) the Subscription Term and (ii) the License Fees. Unless specified otherwise in the Order Form, the Subscription Term shall be based on monthly or annual periods for payment of the License Fees (the "**Payment Periods**").

**2.5** Licensor may choose to offer Licensee a trial period specified by Licensor to test the Software in a dedicated testing environment not subject to License Fees (the "**Trial Period**")**.**Licensor may also choose to offer Licensee extended trial periods subject to License Fees (“Extended Trial Period”). These Trial Periods and/or Extended Trial Periods will automatically end upon completion and do not require termination. Licensee acknowledges that converting from a Trial Period and/or Extended Trial Period to a regular Subscription Term may require additional steps, as outlined in the Order Form. Upon expiration of the Trial Period and/or Extended Trial Period, the right to test the Software shall cease without further notice. Licensee shall then be required to execute an Order Form to obtain a License for a Subscription Term in case the Software shall be further used.

**2.6** The Order Form can include usage-based pricing models based on factors such as monthly active users or number of exports. The pricing can also be based on Licensee’s company size. Licensee shall not make any false statements in regard to the eligibility thresholds stated on the Order Form or relevant for pricing. Further Licensee is solely responsible to keep Licensor informed about any changes on its part with respect to the eligibility thresholds or aspects relevant for pricing stated on the Order Form.

**2.7**Licensee shall inform Licensor of any "agency relationship”, if necessary under a Non-Disclosure Agreement, under which Licensee effectively shall not be the entity making use of the Software but intends to source the Software for use by a third party. In such case, Licensor shall be free to execute an Agreement with the entity effectively making use of the Software as Licensee only.

### **3. Grant of Rights**

**3.1** Licensor shall grant to Licensee a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to use the Software subject to the terms of this Agreement, in particular with the specifications as set out in the Order Form (the "**License**").

**3.2** The License shall pertain to the Software in object code format as well as to content data (fonts, stickers, stock images, etc.) included therein. In case the disclosure of the Software in source code format is agreed upon in the Order Form, the License shall also pertain to the Software in source code format.

**3.3** The License shall be limited to the right (i) to copy and – in case of disclosure in source code format – modify the Software for integration into one of Licensee's products (website or app) (the "**Licensee’s Product**") in accordance with the requirements of interfaces and implementation guidelines as issued by Licensor (the "**Integrated Software**") and (ii) to copy, distribute and make available the Integrated Software to Licensee's end customers.

**4.2** Licensee shall not redistribute the Software or its modifications other than by integrating the Software into Licensee's Product. Use in context of more than one of Licensee's Products shall require multiple Licenses accordingly via respective Order Forms. Licensee's Product shall have a substantially different functionality than the Software (i.e. must not be described as a photo editor and/or video editor, respective development kit, library, or product commercially competing with the Software); otherwise, Licensor shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement and revoke the License at any time.

**4.3** Licensee shall not use the Software in connection with or to promote any products, services, or materials that constitute or promote spyware, adware, or other malicious programs or code, unsolicited mass distribution of email (spam), defamatory, pornographic, abusive or otherwise offensive content; otherwise, Licensor shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement and revoke the License at any time.

A list of the OSS Components and Third Party Components with reference to the applicable licensing terms is accessible online via [**https://img.ly/acknowledgements**](https://img.ly/acknowledgements).

**7.3** Unless specified otherwise in the Order Form, the License Fees shall be paid in Euros. All amounts stated in the Order Form are excluding any applicable value added tax (VAT), unless explicitly specified otherwise. Licensee shall be responsible for any applicable sales, use, value added or similar taxes payable with respect to the licensing of the Software, or arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, other than taxes levied or imposed based upon Licensor's income or gross revenues.

### **8. Delivery and Maintenance**

**8.1** The Software shall be delivered via download from designated package repositories. The designated link for such download shall be provided in the Order Form.

In case of planned maintenance leading to downtime exceeding three hours, Licensor will notify Licensee via email.

### **9. Term and Termination**

**9.1** The term of the License shall be determined in the Order Form (the "**Subscription Term**"). The License shall commence upon initial payment of the License Fees and expire upon the end of the Subscription Term(s). Unless stated otherwise in the Order Form, the initial Subscription Term shall automatically be extended by further consecutive Subscription Terms unless either party notifies the other in writing of its intent not to extend the License prior to the end of the current Subscription Term. For monthly Subscription Terms, the notification must be given one week prior to the end of the then-current Subscription Term in order to be valid. For other Subscription Terms, the notification must be given one month prior to the end of the then-current Subscription Term in order to be valid. Upon expiration of the Subscription Term(s), the right to use the Software shall cease without further notice. To the extent the Subscription Term is not specified in the Order Form, Licensor shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement and revoke the License at any time.

**9.2** Either Party shall be entitled to immediately terminate this Agreement or suspend any rights granted hereunder upon notice to the other in the event that: (i) the other Party breaches any material term of this Agreement, Licensor may particularly revoke the License in case of default or other non-payment of License Fees; or (ii) upon the other Party's dissolution, liquidation, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, or similar agent for the Party's business or property. A change of control of Licensee, the sale of all or more than 50% of Licensee's assets, or a merger or reorganization of Licensee in which Licensee is not the surviving organization is considered dissolution of Licensee. In the event that Licensor terminates this Agreement for breach, all amounts due or to become due under this Agreement shall immediately become due and payable.

**9.3** Upon expiration of the Subscription Term or termination, each Party shall promptly remit to the other all unpaid monies due, or to become due, under this Agreement. Licensee shall return to Licensor or destroy all copies of the Software in its possession and provide written confirmation to that effect; this particularly applies to the Software in source code format in case such disclosure has occurred. In case of termination or revocation of the License, paid monies or due payments for any commenced Payment Periods shall not be refunded to Licensee.

**9.4** In addition to those provisions which by their nature are intended to survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or any license granted hereunder, Sections 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement shall specifically survive such expiration or termination.

**9.5** In the event of termination or expiration of the Subscription Term, the Licensee is obliged to promptly cease use of and remove the Software from all of its products. Until the Software is confirmed to be completely removed from all of the Licensee's products, Licensor reserves the right to continue to charge the Licensee the agreed License Fees. The Licensee must provide satisfactory evidence of the complete removal of the Software upon request of the Licensor.

### **10. Warranty Claims**

**10.1** Product descriptions shall not be deemed guaranteed unless separately agreed in writing.

**10.2** Rights in case of defects shall be excluded in case of minor or immaterial deviations from the characteristics of the Software or in the case of only slight impairment of use. Licensor shall further not be responsible for defects which are caused by improper use or operation.

### **11. Limitation of Liability**

**11.1** Licensor shall be liable without restriction for damages caused intentionally or with gross negligence by Licensor, its legal representatives or assistants in performance. Licensor shall also be liable without restriction for death, personal injury or damage to health caused by Licensor, its legal representatives or assistants in performance. Furthermore, Licensor shall be liable without restriction for damages in accordance with the German Product Liability Act.

**11.2** Licensor shall be liable for damages caused by breach of its primary obligations under this Agreement by Licensor, its legal representatives or assistants in performance. Primary obligations are such duties that form the essence of the Agreement, which were decisive for the conclusion of the Agreement and on the performance of which Licensee may rely. If Licensor breaches its primary obligations with simple negligence, then its liability shall be limited to the amount which was foreseeable for Licensor at the time when the respective duty was performed. Any further liability of Licensor shall be excluded on the merits. In particular, any liability of Licensor for initial defects of the Software already present at the start of the Subscription Term shall be excluded.

**11.3** The right to set off a claim shall be limited to such claims that are uncontested or have been finally established with legal effect.

### **12. Confidentiality**

**12.1** Each Party may be granted access to confidential information of the other Party during the term of this Agreement. Confidential information does not include information that: (i) is or becomes publicly available through no act or omission of the other party, (ii) is rightfully acquired by the recipient from a third party that was not under an obligation to hold the information in confidence, (iii) is independently developed by the recipient or, (iv) is previously known to the recipient without non-disclosure obligations. The terms of this Agreement and the source code to the Software shall constitute confidential information under this Agreement.

**12.2** Neither Party shall use any confidential information of the other Party other than for the purpose of exercising its rights or performing its obligations under this Agreement or disclose to any third party any confidential information of the other Party except as permitted under this Agreement. Disclosure of confidential information shall not be precluded if such disclosure is in response to a valid order of a court or other governmental body or is otherwise required by statutory law.

**12.3** Subject to the exceptions under Section 12.2., Licensee shall not disclose the terms of this Agreement to any third party.

**12.4** Non-disclosure agreements executed by the Parties independent from this Agreement shall remain in force.

**13.2** Licensor shall not accept, and this Agreement does not operate as an acceptance of, any different or additional terms and conditions, and this Agreement shall prevail over any such different or additional provisions, of any Licensee's order.

**13.3** All notices or reports shall be in writing or sent by email.

**13.4** Licensee may not assign this Agreement, in whole or in part to any third party without the prior written consent of Licensor.

**13.6** This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany; the regulations of the UN Sales Convention shall be excluded.

**13.7** The courts for Licensor's registered office shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes under and in connection with this Agreement.

**13.8** Should any provision of this Agreement be or become invalid, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining terms. In such event, the Parties shall be obliged to cooperate in the creation of terms which achieve such legally valid result as comes closest commercially to that of the invalid provision. The above shall apply accordingly to the closing of any gaps in the Agreement.
